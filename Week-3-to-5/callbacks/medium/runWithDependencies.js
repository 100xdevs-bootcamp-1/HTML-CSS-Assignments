// Problem Description – Task Execution with Dependencies
//
// You are given a set of asynchronous tasks where some tasks depend
// on the completion of others.
// Your goal is to execute each task only after all of its dependencies
// have been successfully completed.
// The solution should ensure correct execution order and handle
// dependency relationships properly.
//
// Each task is asynchronous and must invoke a callback when finished.
// Invoke finalCallback after all tasks have completed, or with an error
// if any task fails.

function runWithDependencies(tasks, finalCallback) {}

module.exports = runWithDependencies;
