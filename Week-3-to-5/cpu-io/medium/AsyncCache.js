// Problem Description – Async Cache with Time-to-Live (TTL)

// You are required to create an asynchronous cache utility that exposes a get(key, fetcher) method. 
// If the requested key already exists in the cache, the cached value should be returned immediately. 
// If the key does not exist, the fetcher function should be executed to retrieve the value, 
// store it in the cache, and automatically remove the entry after a fixed Time-to-Live (TTL) of 5 seconds.
class AsyncCache {
  constructor(ttl = 5000) {}

  async get(key, fetcher) {}
}

module.exports = AsyncCache;
