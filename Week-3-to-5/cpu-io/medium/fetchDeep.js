// Problem Description – Recursive Fetch with Redirect Handling

// You are required to fetch data for a given set of IDs. 
// Each response may contain a redirectId, indicating that the data should be fetched again using the new ID. 
// The process must continue until the final data is reached. 
// Your implementation should also detect and prevent infinite redirect loops.

async function fetchDeep(ids, fetcher, maxDepth = 5) {}
